Install Kali tools automatically

## About
This repository is designed to install a comprehensive range of Kali tools on other Linux distributions, (Tested only on Ubuntu). I plan to add many more features and tools in the near future. 
- Note: This script currently supports only Bash and Zsh shells for the automatic installation of Go. If you're using a different shell, you'll need to manually add the Go bin path to your system's paths.

## Usage 
`cd kalifyer`
`python3 install.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Debian OS (Possibly more distros in the future)

## To install Burpsuite:
1. `cd web_downloads`
2. `chmod +x burpsuite_community.sh`
3. `./burpsuite_community.sh`
